# minesweeper-game
This is a console-based version of the classic Minesweeper game implemented in Python. The game is played on an 8x8 grid with 10 bombs placed randomly. Players can perform actions such as flagging, unflagging, and digging to either mark or reveal cells. The objective is to flag all bombs correctly without triggering any of them!
